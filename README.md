# Multi-Page Website HTML Structure Project

## Project Overview
This project involves creating a simple multi-page website structure using only HTML. The focus is on semantic structure and organization without any styling. The website consists of a homepage, projects page, articles page, and a contact page with a form.

## Project Requirements
- [x] Create multiple HTML pages for a website:
  - [x] Homepage (index.html)
  - [x] Projects page (projects.html)
  - [x] Articles page (articles.html)
  - [x] Contact page with a form (contact.html)
- [x] Implement a navigation bar on all pages, linking to each page
- [x] Use semantic HTML5 tags for structure (e.g., `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`)
- [x] Include SEO meta tags in the `<head>` section of each page
- [x] Create a contact form with fields for name, email, subject, and message
- [x] Ensure the structure is ready for future CSS styling
